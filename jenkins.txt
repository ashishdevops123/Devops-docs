for applications developed in java

we use maven as a build tool
    In Maven we have goals/build phase
         compile => Creates .class files
         test => runs the unit tests and generates the reports. This will also try to compile
         package => creates the jar/war file. This will execute compile + test
         install =>  Create the jar/war file and dependency pom file in M2 Folder
         deploy  =>  copy the final package to the remote repository
         clean => remove the target folder


1.mvn package    
2.mvn compile test package
3.mvn clean package

1 & 2 does same work
 3 deletes the previous workspace and creates again


the below two helps to view them on your console

Test results = target/surefire-reports/*.xml   ===== publish junit test results

artifacts    = target/*.jar   or target/*.war  ===== Archieve the artifacts



Different projects can be run at build-in-node or nodes that are configured to master 

using labels

jenkins to build pipelines using two approaches

scripted pipeline
Declarative pipeline
