$env:PATH=$env:PATH+';C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application'
adding the path to $env:PATH SO that chrome launches from the command line because the operating system has path 
where it can search for the exe and it is temporary

so to do it manually we need to do so much
to resolve this chocolatey a windows package manager used

    choco install terraform -y
    refreshenv
    terraform --version


terraform important commands

terraform validate  It will check the configuration terraform configuration file (eg main.tf) will be checked  and throws errors if any
terraform plan It will show infrastructure that is going to create.
terraform apply  It will make the infrastructure withrespect to the configuration is created.
terraform show   It will  show the information related to the existing infra that was created.

anatomy of terraform functioning
Terraform first validate the config file , and creates the infrastructure and generates stores the existing 
infra state details in tfstate  if any changes done then tfstate.backup is created to maintain the 
previous infra config and the tfstate file is updated.



terraform ===> resources  ==> arguments             ====> attributes
          ===> s3,vpc     ==> required input values ====> arguments

variables are used in terraform so that the values which may change depending 
up on the requirements are categories so that we can able to change the variable so that we cannot change entire config file.
